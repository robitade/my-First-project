            <h3>Healthy Snacks</h3>
        </b>
        <p>
            Consider having a small, nutritious snack if you have a long gap between breakfast and lunch.
            Opt for fruits, nuts, or yogurt. These snacks can help maintain energy levels throughout the
            morning and prevent overeating during later meals. They also provide essential vitamins,
            minerals, and fiber necessary for a balanced diet.

                Quality Sleep
            </h3>
        </b>
        <p>
            Ensure you get adequate sleep each night. Create a relaxing bedtime routine and maintain a
            consistent sleep schedule. Quality sleep is essential for physical and mental health, and it
            contributes significantly to your overall well-being and productivity throughout the day. Avoid
            screens and caffeine close to bedtime and aim for 7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

            <h3>Productive Environment
            </h3>
        </b>
        <p>
            Prepare your workspace or to-do list the night before to kickstart a productive morning without
            feeling overwhelmed. A clutter-free and organized environment can help reduce stress levels
            and increase focus, allowing you to tackle tasks more efficiently. Additionally, ensure your
            workspace has proper lighting and is ergonomically set up to promote a comfortable and
            productive work atmosphere.
